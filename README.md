# healthcare_startup_hospital_visits
Predictive Python model that determines the likelihood of patient readmissions within 30 days of discharge.

SCENARIO

A healthcare startup is interested in developing a machine learning model to predict patient readmission rates based on various patient data points collected from their hospital visits. The company aims to utilise Python's extensive libraries and machine learning frameworks to analyse the provided historical patient data and build a predictive model that can help hospitals reduce unnecessary readmissions, thus saving costs and improving patient care.
Your task is to develop a predictive model using Python to determine the likelihood of patient readmissions within 30 days of discharge based on the provided dataset. This project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, and model evaluation.

SOURCE:

• The dataset provided includes various patient data points such as age, gender, type of admission, length of stay, number of diagnoses, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, previous admissions, and readmission status.

YOUR REPORT SHOULD FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING:

• Data Preprocessing and Cleanup

• Exploratory Data Analysis and Insights

• Feature Selection and Justification

• Model Development and Selection

• Model Evaluation and Testing
